# aws-aliased-profiles

The Issue:

You have a bunch of accounts in an organization. You want to be able to use the
--profile flag easily and don't want to add profiles to the ~/.aws/config file
for each. This tool fetches the accounts in your organization, fetches the
aliases associated with each account in your organization, and then inserts
the profiles necessary into your config file.

To fetch all accounts in your organization and their aliases, run the following command:

```sh
aws-aliased-profiles fetch -masterProfile root -accountRole Production
```

You can leave out -masterProfile if your default config in ~/.aws/config is
sufficient to gather a list of accounts from the organization.

The accountRole option specifies the role to assume when getting STS tokens for
alias retrieval in the account. For example, something like ReadOnly,
Production, ProductionAdmin, etc. Each team names this according to their own
style.

The upsert command uses the downloaded account IDs and aliases to build new
profiles and insert them into the ~/.aws/config file.

```sh
aws-aliased-profiles upsert
```

The profiles inserted into the `~/.aws/config` file are generated by populating
a template file at `~/.aws/aliased-accounts.tmpl`. You need to place something like
the following in the file named above. You will need to change MyFavRoleToAssume to
the role you want to assume when using the profile. Often, this is the same profile
used in the `fetch` command.

```
[profile {{ alias }}]
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::{{ accountId }}:role/MyFavRoleToAssume
source_profile = default
```

After that, you should be able to use all your profiles readily...

```sh
aws --profile staging-123 sts get-caller-identity
{
    "UserId": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP:botocore-session-1234567890",
    "Account": "987654321",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::987654321234:assumed-role/MyFavRoleToAssume/botocore-session-1234567890"
}
```
